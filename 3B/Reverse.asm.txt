; Purpose       To copy and reverse and array, while performing the following
;               additional operations to decrypt the Secret Message. After
;               reading in a value, we decrypt the value by
;		a. dividing the value by 3
;               b. then adding 32 to the value
;               c. storing the value

DIVISOR         equ     3       ; Value in supplied array will be divided by
                                ; this value
ADDED_VALUE     equ     32      ; Divided value will have 32 added to it
